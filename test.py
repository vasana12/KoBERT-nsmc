it's been just over a year since ibought my tesla power wall or had itinstalled and sonow we're back to take a look at all thedata and understand the value that thesekind of systems bringwhether or not it was worth it orwhether or not i made a big mistakelet's goat my house i have two tesla power wallsthese are the powerwall twosand they each have 13.5 kilowatt hoursof energy in them giving me a totalof 27 kilowatt hours of backup energywith that i'm also able to charge mycars at night from the grid because thecars take a ton of energyand would just eat these things alivejust to think about it the tesla model yand the tesla model x both have 80 pluskilowatt hoursand remember two power walls combinedare 27 kilowatt hours sothe way i have it set up essentially atmidnight when i reach what's calledsuper off peak timei just go completely back to the gridthe house isn't generally doing much youknow i have kids we're in bed by nineyou know midnight nothing's happeningbut the cars need to charge and theyneed to pull a ton of energyand i'd rather do that at this supercheap rate and then kind ofyou know have to shave it off laterwhich i'll talk about in a secondand so that was kind of the main ideawas to use this to do this thing calledpeak shavingand actually save money by owning thesedevices and allowing me to controlwhen i'm pulling from the grid and wheni'm not now when i first got theminstalled anafterthought i had was that these wouldhelp in the event of a blackout butin southern california the weather'spretty calm there's not really anythinggoing on that would really cause thisuntil the power company started shuttingoff people's power to prevent firesbecause we do have fires in kind of theeastern part of the stateso with that this became in much morehandy and we'll cover that towards theend after we get through the costbreakdownfor the cost breakdown there's a lot toconsider and remember that i also havesolar panels sobefore i got solar panels installed iwas spending about 140a month this included charging electriccars running air conditioning and areally mild climate in san diego notsomething thatyou know like phoenix or las vegas orsomewhere like that i think it'sextremely hotand a thousand square foot home so it'sa small home but because we're usingelectric cars and all that our energyneeds were actually pretty high i thenadded solar panels a 5.3 kilowatt systemand this dropped my monthly electricitybill down to 35which put me at a per kilowatt hourpricing of 13 centswhich was down from 23 cents is which iwas paying beforethen when i got the power wall mymonthly bill dropped down to 18which is about a six cent kilowatt houraverage now this includes thesenon-bypassable charges sothere's some kind of taxes and fees andstuff just to be connected to the gridthat you have to payand there really isn't a way to getaround that so all of that comes intoconsideration here but really right nowit's about as low as it can possibly bei'm paying less than a dollar a dayalmost like 50 60 centsa day for energy which includes kind offueling like gas money you would spendon my two electric cars but of coursethe solar panels themselves cost moneyso we have to kind of factor that in wecan't just assume they were freeand we're saving the exact differencebetween the before and afterso the solar panel system costs twentythousand dollarsminus a thirty percent federal itc thisis a tax credit that you getbringing the total for my system down tofourteen thousand dollarsif you divide that by 25 years or 300monthsyou get 47 a month this is what we callthe amortization or the amortized costof that solar system on my roof so youhave to add that back into the savingspreviously to get kind of atrue savings compared to what i waspaying before i had solarso when you add that cost back in you'relooking at a savings per month from justthe solar panels of 58that's the net savings just from goingsolarthen i have another 17 in savings byowning a powerwallgiving me a total savings of 75 dollarsa month but of course that powerwallsystem also wasn't freenow this system would have cost around13 000 had i bought it directly fromteslausing kind of retail pricing afterincentives but i ended up getting thesepower walls for free from the teslareferral program thank you to everyonethat used my codeand because of that i only had to pay 2750for the install so amortizing that costacross the 10-year warranty gives me anadded cost per month of 22or 5 dollars more than it was actuallysaving me and if you had paid the fullamount the 13000 that means that you would be payingabout 108a month for these power walls which isabout six timesthe cost of the savings i'm gettingafter also having solarso as we discovered before when you canuse the grid as yourbackup battery through net energymetering or nem which applies to38 states plus some u.s territories itdoesn't really make financially sense toget a power wallhowever if i didn't have solar thiswould make good sensein that once you pay more than 14 centsper kilowatt houryou'll be making money on the dealacross that 10-year warranty periodat least according to one study by somestudents at stanford now the secondreason that i mentioned before at thetopwere blackouts in the past year at myhouse here in san diego we've had ahandful of blackoutsone time i actually saw the lightsflicker and i was upset because we'dbeen kind of having issues with ourpower wall syncing and everything then iwent outside to check and i realizedthat the entire neighborhood was withoutpower and that flickerwas the momentary loss from the gridthat my gateway had to switch from thattomy power wall and that changed myperspective quite a bit on this wholesituation and the financial viability ofit so this begs the questionhow long could you go without having thegridand that's a bit of a tricky answer buthere's my best guessi use around 28 kilowatt hours per dayof electricitymy solar panels generate about 24kilowatt hours per day soeventually i'm going to run out of juicehowever in a real grid down situationwe'd shift our energy needs to make surethat we used lessthan our solar panels generated lessthan that 24 kilowatt hours per daylimitthen from there we should be able toessentially go on foreverwith the exception of any days whichhave less sun thanothers which aren't a lot here in sandiegobut with the fires recently and justkind of june gloom and some of the otherweatherthings that are changing here theydefinitely are present once in a whileso is the tesla powerwall worth it afterone year or did i make a huge financialmistakewell considering i only had to pay forthe install it's a no-brainer for me buteven if i did have to pay full pricethe comfort knowing that during a blackup my family would be safeand we would still have full power toour entire housethat to me is worth it okay but ifthat's all i'm doing here with the powerwalls couldn't i go with the natural gasgeneratorthey're cheaper right a natural gasgenerator to power my whole house wouldcost around five thousand dollarsaccording to angie's listthen you have to factor in thissemi-annual maintenance of 300a year across 10 years and you have atotal cost of right around 8 000for one of these things so if you wantedto stack that up against what i havewhich are two power walls which came inright around fourteen thousand dollarsyeah it would definitely be cheaperbut if all i really cared about wasbackup power overnightin the event of an outage i really onlyneed one power wall whichwould cost right around the same priceright around eight thousand dollarsso similar price overall but the powerwall does offer a few advantages thatthe natural gas generator just can'thelp you withfirst you don't need natural gas topower it you can refill your power walldirectly from sunlight and the solarpanels on your houseso if your power was out and the gascompany cut gas for some reasonwell your generator wouldn't do you anygood whereas a power wall would stillfunctionthe second one is that the power walllets you buy energy when it's cheaperand then go off grid duringpeak times every single day saving youmoneyto break that down if i were to look atpeak usage which is about nine kilowatthours for my house at a price of 53cents per kilowatt hourthat cost me just under five bucks fourdollars and 77 centsnow the super off peak time from 12 a.mto 6 a.m when i would refill my powerwallsthat would only cost me 81 cents forthat same amount of energyso small dollars here but it you knowadds up so the power wall savings thereisjust under dollars and ninety six centsper yearthat's fourteen hundred forty fivedollars and forty cents and over thatten year life spanthe power wall would save me fourteenthousand four hundred fifty four dollarsthis means that if i didn't have solarand i just wanted to use the power wallto offset those peak charges which i candowith kind of going off grid and comingback and filling it up at nightwell i would save just about 14 500over the life of the system which afterthe costof that system would mean i would profitabout sixthousand dollars so when it comes downto it againwhat's the price you would be willing topay for knowing that your family is safeduring an outageleave me a comment below and let me knowwhat you think would youdo the same setup as i would would youhave a different setup what would reallypush you over the edge and make you tobuy one of these systems or not let meknow i'm really curiousalso if you want to see my first videoabout this installationand how i actually did it and all theconsiderations there's a lot to itcheck out this video over here that ihave and make sure to subscribe for morebecause the powerwall is something thati'm really excited about and i think alot of people should exploremore in depth and it's a lot cheaper toget going than you know a 50 or 100 000car so thanks again for watchingeveryone and don't forget when you freethe data your mind will followi'll see you guys back here in the nextone
